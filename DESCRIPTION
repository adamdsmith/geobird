Title: Query an eBird database by geography (e.g., shapefiles)

Description: Functions to read and parse eBird database requests (.txt), store them in a local
    SQLite database, and to request geographic queries of that database based on user-provided
    shapefiles.  Users may optionally buffer the shapefiles by any distance.  Additionally,
    functions are available to visualize the monthly phenology of eBird records by species for
    a given geography and produce a spreadsheet with eBird records by season as well as some
    additional information when buffers are specified.  In the latter, seasonal abundance codes
    are assigned to each species based on the proportion of complete eBird checklists (i.e.,
    observers reported all species observed), provided some minimum number of checklists is
    present for a given geography and season.  Current functionality is limited to the United
    States, but there is little to prevent the expansion of the methods to other areas or
    georeferenced species occurrence databases.
