\description{
This function parses the tab-delimited text files (.txt) provided by Cornell.  Only fields
relevant to the calculation of species-level geographic occurrence are preserved, and
filters are applied to remove eBird records that were not identified to at least the species
level, duplicate records present in group checklists and non-approved records.  Records for
species with an unspecified count of individuals are assigne a minimum value (i.e., 1) to
indicate occurrence.
